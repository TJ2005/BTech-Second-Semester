# Signals & Systems lecture 2

## Logic

- Compare with general to find fundamental time $T_1$ and $T_2$
	- General Equation is $t(x) = A \sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{T} t\right)$
- If the ratio of $T_1$ and $T_2$ then the given [[signal]] is [[periodic]].
- They will sometimes ask to calculate [[fundamental time period]]
- [[Fundamental Time period]] = [[L.C.M.]] of $T_1$ and $T_2$

## Deterministic v/s Non Deterministic Signal
##### Deterministic Signal
A signal whose characteristics can be completely represented or described in a mathematical equation is called deterministic signal.
##### Non Deterministic Signal
A signal whose characteristics can not be represented or described in a mathematical equation is called non deterministic signal.

## Even v/s Odd Signal
is also called Symmetric v/s Antisymmetric

##### Even Signal
A signal which exhibits symmetry at $t = 0$ is **Even** or **Symmetric** Signal
- Also Symmetric
- $x(t) = x(-t)$
- Cosine(x) is an even signal
##### Odd Signal
	A signal which exhibits anti-symmetry at $t = 0$ 
- Also Antisymmetric
