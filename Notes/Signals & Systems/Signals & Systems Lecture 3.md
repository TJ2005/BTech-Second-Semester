# Signals & Systems Lecture 3


We have to characteristics even signal and odd signal. In exams they can ask a reverse engineering type question where they provide two signals and they ask us to determine which is which.

## Content

### Determining The parity of the signal
#### Even
The even part of a signal \( x(t) \), denoted as \( X_e(t) \), is given by:
$X_e(t) = \frac{1}{2} [x(t) + x(-t)]$
#### Odd
For an odd signal it will be
$X_e(t) = \frac{1}{2} [x(t) - x(-t)]$
